Welcome to the Inventory Management System Help Guide!

As a regular user (viewer), you can:

1. Log in with your username and password.
2. View the inventory dashboard to see all items and their details.
3. Use the search page to find items by name, category, or status.
4. You cannot add, edit, or delete items. Only admins can do that.
5. If you have questions about how to use the system, ask the AI Chat Assistant on the Chat page.
6. To log out, click the Logout button in the navigation bar.

If you need more help, type your question in the chat assistant!
